        <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy was last revised on September 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the Odiance Corp., a Canadian corporation, (&ldquo;Odiance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Odiance,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) social network, streaming platform and digital performance platform consisting of Web sites, services, software applications, embeddable players, and syndicated &lsquo;widgets&rsquo; (the &ldquo;Odiance Service&rdquo;). Odiance values the privacy of the users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit and use the Odiance Service (collectively or individually, &ldquo;you,&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rdquo; or &ldquo;Users&rdquo;).</p>
        <p>We know that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Odiance when you use the Odiance Service, how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.odiance.com/static/static_pages/terms_of_service">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to Odiance&rsquo;s Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>By using the Odiance Service, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
        <p><strong>User-Provided Information.</strong>&nbsp;You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, if you register for a User account with the Odiance Service. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Odiance Service. You may provide us information in user submissions you post, stream or include in the Odiance Service (collectively &ldquo;User Submissions&rdquo;). We may collect payment information, such as your credit card number and expiration date, where appropriate to process a financial transaction you have requested. We may also collect information from publicly available sources or through third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>Information About Your Use of the Odiance Service.</strong>&nbsp;In addition to the information you provide to us directly, we may collect information about your use of the Odiance Service. For example, we may collect:</p>
        <p><u>Device information</u>&nbsp;- such as your hardware model, IP address, other unique device identifiers, operating system version, and settings of the device you use to access the Odiance Service.</p>
        <p><u>Usage information</u>&nbsp;- such as information about the Odiance Service you use, the time and duration of your use of the Odiance Service and other information about your interaction with content offered through a Service, and any information stored in cookies and similar technologies that we have set on your device. For detailed information about our use of cookies, web beacons, and other technologies.</p>
        <p><u>Location information</u>&nbsp;- such as your computer&rsquo;s IP address, your mobile device&rsquo;s GPS signal or information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Odiance Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Information From Third-Party Sources.</strong>&nbsp;We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Odiance Service through that site.</p>
        <p><strong>Other Information We Collect.</strong>&nbsp;We also may collect other information about you, your device, or your use of the services in ways that we describe to you at the point of collection or otherwise with your consent. You may choose not to provide us with certain types of information but doing so may affect your ability to use some of the Odiance Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:</p>
        <p>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials, so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service.</p>
        <p>Cookies can help us, and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors&rsquo; access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Odiance Service and provide you with a better experience.</p>
        <p>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don&rsquo;t receive the same ad each time you access an Odiance Service.</p>
        <p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Odiance Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Beacons.</strong>&nbsp;We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or &ldquo;pixels&rdquo;) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Odiance Service and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
        <p><strong>Local Storage &amp; Other Tracking Technologies.</strong>&nbsp;We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as &ldquo;Flash cookies&rdquo;) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Odiance Service. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.</p>
        <p><strong>Log File Information.&nbsp;</strong>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use the Odiance Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
        <p><strong>Clear Gifs Information.&nbsp;</strong>When you use the Odiance Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Odiance account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Odiance better for our users.</p>
        <p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
        <p>We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Odiance Service.</p>
        <p>By providing Odiance your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Odiance Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we may send you notifications of activity on the Odiance Service to the email address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. We may use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Odiance Service, or special offers. If you purchase a ticket for an Odiance performance, then we may share your email address directly with the artist performing so that they may update their fans directly regarding the performance. You may opt-out of any artist communications by contacting the artist directly or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@odiance.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20-%20Communication%20Affairs">contacting us</a>. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your account page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Odiance Service-related e-mails.</p>
        <p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, Odiance may retain your profile information and User Submissions for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, Odiance may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Submissions) contained in your communications to other Users posted to public or semi-public areas of the Odiance Service after termination or deactivation of your account.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Odiance Service, we will ask you for that person's email address and automatically send an email invitation. Odiance stores this information to send this email, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service. Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.

        <p>Odiance may use certain information about you and/or your User Submissions internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Odiance Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content.</p>
        <p>To Deliver Targeted Advertising. We may use your information to facilitate the delivery of targeted ads, promotions, and offers to you, on behalf of ourselves and advertisers, on and off the Odiance Service.</p>
        <p>Odiance reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Submissions you post on the Odiance Service. We reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Service, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. Odiance also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>
        <p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our Odiance Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; (h) track User Submissions and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i) automatically update any Odiance widgets or applications.</p>

        <p><strong>Business Partners.</strong>&nbsp;We may share your information with business partners to provide you with services that you request.

        <p>Odiance may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Odiance Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Odiance. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. Odiance does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Odiance to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. In addition, third-party advertisers and retailers may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

        <p><strong>VII. Broadcaster Payments.</strong></p>
        <p>Users may pay a fee and use Odiance to view your Odiance Performances. Subject to certain per-user minimums and subject to for-charity Odiance Performances and limited time trials (in each case based upon the functionality of the Odiance Service and incorporated herein), you may set the amount that a user pays to stream your Odiance Performance. Additionally, you may dictate the manner in which Users pay (e.g. tipping, ticketing) based upon the available functionality of the Odiance Services.</p>
        <p>We will maintain a proceeds account into which we will deposit proceeds derived from your Odiance Performances and against which we will debit the Odiance Fee payable by you to us (described in the foregoing sentence) and all expenses including, but not limited to broadcast costs, bandwidth costs, royalty payments, software fees, licensing fees, merchant and transaction fees, merchant reserves, returns, chargebacks, overhead and any applicable sales taxes. In consideration of Odiance providing its services in connection with the Odiance Services, Odiance shall have the free right to deduct from the total amount of the proceeds derived from your Odiance Performances a fee (the &ldquo;Odiance Fee&rdquo;). &nbsp;The amount of the Odiance Fee is dependent on the Total Gross Revenue from your Odiance Performance. Artist agrees to the Odiance Fee outlined in this page: https://www.odiance.com/static/static_pages/how_to_get_paid</p>
        <p>During the Term, within ten (10) business days of your request, we will remit to you the money in your proceeds account, less applicable fees and expenses (as described herein); provided, however, that we will withhold payment until the total amount due to you is at least twenty-five dollars (US$25.00). Notwithstanding the foregoing we reserve the right to withhold payment if we in good faith determine that additional documentation is necessary to make the payment (e.g. W-9 or identification). You agree that you will be responsible for all taxes incurred as a result of the Broadcaster Payments.</p>
        <p><strong>VIII. Miscellaneous.</strong></p>
        <p>The expiration of the Term of this Agreement will not relieve either party from their respective obligations incurred prior to or during the Term. Accordingly, the provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply even after the expiration of the Term.</p>
        <p>If we receive a claim that our distribution of your Broadcaster Submissions or any other materials provided or authorized by you violates any third party rights or if a claim arises from your breach or alleged breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein, you agree to fully indemnify and hold us harmless, and upon our request, defend us and our licensees and affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, contractors and employees) from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs) concerning any such claim. Accordingly, you agree to reimburse us and our licensees and our affiliates on demand for any payments made in resolution of any liability or claim that is subject to indemnification under this paragraph. We will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you of any such claim, and by obtaining, posting and maintaining an adequate bond for our benefit you may assume control of the defense of such claim, provided that we will have the right in all events to participate in the defense thereof. Additionally, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from and against anything including all losses or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, costs, and expenses) arising out of any claims by any partner that relates to your withdrawal of your Broadcaster Submissions (such as claims alleging unfair business practices, or price discrimination).</p>
        <p>The Agreement and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Odiance without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Agreement shall be void.
